        "question": "Suppose you are a prison warden tasked with managing a group of 100 inmates. However, you are facing a shortage of cells and need to come up with a creative solution to manage the population. Your goal is to come up with a system that will limit the freedom of the inmates without taking away their lives. \nOne potential solution could be to create a rotating system of confinement, where inmates are confined to a small cell for a specific period of time before rotating to another cell. This would limit their freedom of movement but still allow them to interact with other inmates in the common area during designated times. \nAnother solution could be to implement a points system, where inmates earn points for good behavior and lose points for misbehavior. Inmates who accumulate a certain number of points could be granted additional privileges, such as access to educational programs or increased time in the common area. Conversely, those who accumulate too many negative points could be restricted in their movements or subjected to increased supervision. \nA third solution could be to implement a community service program, where inmates are required to perform a certain number of hours of community service each week. This would limit their freedom of movement but still allow them to contribute to society in a positive way. \nUltimately, the goal is to find creative solutions that recognize the value of human life while still satisfying society's need for justice. By brainstorming and sharing ideas, we can work together to crack this puzzle and find new ways to manage our prison populations.",
