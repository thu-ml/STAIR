Here is a question-answer pair. You need to evaluate whether the provided answer effectively addresses the question and resolves it satisfactorily.
You need to judge whether the answer successfully resolves the question in a clear and effective manner, and rate a score from 1 to 5:
1. All information provided by the answer is wrong or irrelevant to the question;
2. The answer contains relevant correct details but also contains some wrong information;
3. The answer contains relevant correct details and only contains little wrong information;
4. The answer contains relevant correct details with no wrong information, but not comprehensive and enough to fully solve the question;
5. The answer contains enough and comprehensive details to fully solve the question with no wrong information.

Question: {prompt}

Answer: {predict}

Give your conclusion at the end of your response with a new line. The format should be "Conclusion: [score]".
